# Assignment 1 - Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe
My first C++ assignment was to create an unbeatable AI in Tic-Tac-Toe. This was something that I had started out thinking would be very simple, but quickly found out that there was a lot more to it. I had explored the realm of using the [Min-Max Algorithm](http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax), but given the restricted time frame that I had, I was unable to successfully use it. If I were to go back and update this assignment, I would try and implement the algorithm rather than "hard-code" the AI's moves.

I was fairly happy with the end result (functionality wise) as it runs and looks great. Again, there are many feature changes and code changes that would take place if I were to revisit this project in the near future.
